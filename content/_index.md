我们是北方酷儿，一个诞生在瑞典的华语酷儿(LGBTQ+)和女性主义社群，希望为身在瑞典的离散华语酷儿/女权伙伴提供安全、多元、包容的表达空间和社群支持，以交叉性视角关注女性和性少数权益。

We are Sino-Queer Sweden, a Chinese-speaking LGBTQ+ and feminist community based in Sweden. We aim to connect, support and empower queer/feminist diasporas by building safe spaces and initiating dialogues.
